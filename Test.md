Subject: Submission of Business Plan Report – “Modern Coffee Shop with Gaming & Coworking Services”

Dear [Instructor/Supervisor Name],

We are pleased to submit our comprehensive Business Plan Report titled *“Modern Coffee Shop with Gaming & Coworking Services”* for your review and consideration. This document outlines our vision to launch a next-generation hybrid café in Bangladesh that uniquely integrates premium coffee, high-speed internet, dedicated coworking zones, private meeting rooms, and immersive gaming experiences.

Our proposal is grounded in extensive market research, demographic trends, and financial feasibility analysis specific to the Bangladeshi context. We believe this innovative model addresses a growing demand among urban youth, freelancers, remote workers, and gamers for a productive yet socially engaging third space beyond home and office.

We appreciate your guidance and look forward to your valuable feedback.

Sincerely,  
**X, Y, Z**  
Co-Founders

### **Executive Summary**

We propose launching **“Nexus Brew”**—a modern hybrid café in Bangladesh that seamlessly blends specialty coffee, professional coworking infrastructure, private meeting pods, and competitive gaming lounges. Targeting Dhaka’s rapidly urbanizing, digitally native population, Nexus Brew fills a critical gap in the market: a safe, high-speed, and community-oriented space where productivity meets leisure.

Bangladesh’s coffee culture is experiencing exponential growth, with the café market projected to reach **USD 135 million by 2025**, growing at **12.3% CAGR** (Statista, 2024). Urban centers like Dhaka, Chattogram, and Sylhet host over **1,200 registered coffee outlets**, yet fewer than 5% offer integrated coworking or gaming amenities. With rising internet penetration (46% as of 2025, BTRC) and a booming freelance workforce (over 650,000 registered on Upwork alone), demand for flexible workspaces is surging.

Our initial investment is estimated at **BDT 4.5 million** (~USD 41,000) for a 1,200 sq. ft. flagship outlet in Dhanmondi, Dhaka. Projected daily footfall ranges from **150–300 customers**, generating **BDT 1.8–3.6 million/month** in revenue at average spend of BDT 120–150 per visit. We anticipate breakeven within **14 months** and 25% net profit margin by Year 2.

Nexus Brew is not just a café—it’s a lifestyle hub for Bangladesh’s digital generation.

**Business Name:** Nexus Brew  
**Legal Structure:** Private Limited Company (Proposed)  
**Location:** Initial launch in Dhanmondi, Dhaka; expansion to Chattogram and Sylhet within 24 months  

**Nature of Business:**  
Nexus Brew operates as a premium hybrid café offering:  
- Specialty coffee & light gourmet meals

- Dedicated coworking desks with ergonomic seating  
- Soundproof private meeting pods (hourly rental)  
- Gaming lounge with PCs, consoles (PS5, Xbox), and LAN tournament setups

**Mission:**  
To empower Bangladesh’s digital natives with a dynamic, inclusive, and inspiring third space that fuels productivity, creativity, and community.

**Tagline:** *“Work. Play. Brew.”*  

**Problem Solved:**  
Urban Bangladesh lacks affordable, reliable, and multifunctional spaces where individuals can work, meet, game, and socialize without compromising on comfort, speed, or ambiance. Existing cafés lack infrastructure; coworking spaces lack leisure; gaming zones lack professionalism. Nexus Brew integrates all three.

### **Industry Analysis**

**Market Share Distribution (Café Industry):**  
- Local chains (e.g., Fresh Cafe, Barista): 45%  
- International brands (Starbucks not present; Costa Coffee exited): 5%  
- Independent cafés: 50%  

**Growth Drivers:**  
- Youth population (60% under 35)  
- 46% internet penetration (BTRC, 2025)  
- 35% increase in remote work post-pandemic (ILO Bangladesh, 2024)

#### **Coffee Market Size & Growth (2020–2025)**

| Year | Market Size (USD Million) | YoY Growth |
|------|----------------------------|------------|
| 2020 | 68                         | 8.1%       |

### **Porter’s Five Forces Analysis**

| Force | Analysis (Bangladesh Context) |
|------|-------------------------------|
| **Competitive Rivalry** | **Moderate-High**: Many small cafés, but few offer integrated services. Differentiation through tech + gaming reduces direct competition. |
| **Threat of New Entrants** | **Moderate**: Low barriers to entry for basic cafés, but high for hybrid models (tech, gaming rigs, permits). Brand loyalty is weak, so early movers gain advantage. |
| **Bargaining Power of Customers** | **High**: Price-sensitive youth segment; many alternatives. Countered by unique value proposition (gaming + coworking). |
| **Bargaining Power of Suppliers** | **Low-Moderate**: Coffee beans imported (Vietnam, Brazil); multiple suppliers. Gaming hardware has global vendors (HP, ASUS). Internet via multiple ISPs (Link3, Fiber@Home). |
| **Threat of Substitutes** | **Moderate**: Home brewing, public libraries, university labs. However, none offer the social + professional + entertainment combo. |

### **Financial Insight**

#### **Revenue Projections (Per Outlet, Monthly)**

| Daily Visitors | Avg. Spend (BDT) | Monthly Revenue (BDT) | Annual Revenue (BDT) |
|----------------|------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|
| 50             | 130              | 195,000                | 2.34 million          |
| 150            | 130              | 585,000                | 7.02 million          |
| 300            | 130              | 1,170,000              | 14.04 million         |

*Assumptions:*  
- Operating 30 days/month  
- Mix of coffee (BDT 80–120), coworking pass (BDT 150/day), gaming (BDT 100/hr)  
- 20% of revenue from memberships & event hosting  

#### **Market Potential & Share**
- Total café-based coffee cups/year: **75.6 million**  
- If Nexus Brew captures **0.5% market share** in Year 1 → **378,000 cups/year**  
- At BDT 100/cup equivalent → **BDT 37.8 million/year (~USD 344,000)**  

Initial target: **1 outlet in Dhaka → 0.1% national café market share**

---

### **Conclusion**

Nexus Brew represents a timely and scalable response to Bangladesh’s evolving urban lifestyle. By fusing coffee culture with the demands of the digital economy—freelancing, remote collaboration, and competitive gaming—we create a defensible niche in a fragmented market. With Dhaka’s youth population, rising internet reliability, and minimal competition in hybrid spaces, the model is primed for rapid adoption.

Our phased rollout—starting in Dhanmondi, then expanding to university zones and tech parks—ensures capital efficiency and brand consistency. Moreover, the integration of membership tiers, event hosting (LAN tournaments, startup meetups), and app-based engagement builds sticky customer relationships.

In a country where “third places” are scarce but desperately needed, Nexus Brew doesn’t just serve coffee—it cultivates community, productivity, and play. We are confident this model will redefine urban social infrastructure in Bangladesh.
